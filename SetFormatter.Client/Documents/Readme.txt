SETS
============================================================================================================================================================
Ultimate Purpose: 
To get a foundational descriptive language based on reductionist values to be reconstructed into a sophisticated, fluid, dynamic and well
ordered mathematical model of a semi-limited universe through the evaluation of taxanomic and relational orders. Various rules are to be provided initially
to facilitate guided growth with increasing channels of input as well as input complexity to study and expand beyond boundary values. The non-terminating
experiment is intended to uncover previously unconsidered concepts in category and information theory while it successively builds new forms of metacognition
with ever increaeing automation.

Foundational concepts include a limited set of imperfect information to be initially analyzed through set theory and mathematical analysis tools. Primitive 
classifications will also be mapped onto artifacts. Newly discovered layers of complexity will be considered as results to be implemented and operationallzed 
in code upon analysis. Upon the next iteration of results that will leverage the preceding, the newest layer of complexity to be implemented should be able 
to reconstruct or resolve these with additional state machine-like abilities (cross dimensional movement) both implicitly and internally. Internal propogation 
of new, potentially contradictory information should be acceptable through the most basic to the most complex levels of the running model, which based on the 
existing paradigms uncovered will determine how best to refine the "known universe" in it's entirety without:

a) dissolution into entropy
b) discarding valuable information, results or systems previously constructed
c) assigning inappropriate value to disparate components or data to fit the latest input
d) halting problems or issues with indefinite resolutions

The starting implementation is a variation based on a well known game called Alchemy. Elements are provided as building blocks which are subsequently 
combined to uncover new elements that then can create other successive combinations. The implementation path starts with a functioning game mechanic; followed
by the introduction of newly written operations for basic analysis; followed by corrective mechanisms for initial information and first order
projections; followed by channels of input absorption and decision-making abilities on what to do with any new information; followed by synthesis of new
potential artifacts that require to be filled by selective input, followed by higher order functions to be discussed later. Primitive categories of artifact
groups will be opened up to the system on an ad-hoc basis, depending on the lexical evolution that has presented itself since cross products between categories
will provide an exponential growth in systemic complexity.

Areas to be addressed with the proposed experiment and its natural extensions include: Comparitive and dynamic framing of problems (analogies); Emergent 
techniques in organising extremely large sets of data and groups; Limits of computational anlysis by systems dependent on initial parameters amd the nature of 
those hard limits; Potentials for previously unknown, unguided cross-discipline discoveries; Optimal representations for sets of data relating to specific 
operational intent (predictive)
